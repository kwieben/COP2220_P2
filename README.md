# COP_2220 Rock/Paper/Sciessors

A program that implements a Rock/Paper/Scissors game that allows the user to play the 
computer. The program should prompt the user to enter R, P,or S for Rock, Paper, or Scissors, 
then it should randomly generate the computerâ€™s choice and determine who won and display 
the result. The program should allow the user to continue playing until the user decides to 
stop, displaying the score (number of times that the computer won, the number of times that 
the player won and the number of ties).
<br />
<br />
In this game, Rock beats (breaks) Scissors, Scissors beats (cuts) Paper, and Paper beats 
(covers) Rock.
<br />
<br />
The program should do error handling on the input values and require the Player toenter 
R, P, S or Q (for quit). The program should accept both upper and lower case letters. The
program output should look like the example output in the last section, including spacing and 
error handling.
